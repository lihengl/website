<h2>More Than Just A Hobby</h2>

<p>
Visual elements play a very important role in my life. I have been doing
art-related things ever since long before I can remember. My tool set ranges
from pencil to Photoshop, and the reason for me to create artworks also ranges
from mood to being paid to do so.<br />
<br />
Image above is a character I made randomly in my every day life. I do not even
remember where the idea came from, but this guy remains to be one of my personal
favorite in years.

<h2>Hand Drawing</h2>

<p>
Among all medium and tools, drawing greyscaled cartoonish characters with jsut
pencil and paper is not only the oldest trick I know, but also my favorite skill
to practice.<br />
<br />
The teacher who taught me how to draw were the comic books that I had access to
during early childhood. Later, some classmates I met at different schools who
happened to be also enjoying drawing things on textbooks have influenced and
diverged my style. I remain thankful to them to this day.<br />
<br />
Picture to the left was drawn and given to a friend of mine as a birthday gift.
A lot of times I drew simple things and gave them away to people, because doing
so not only cost little, but also appears to be a way to make highly
customizable items that can be unique and meaningful. When not giving them away,
drawing to me has always been one way to relax in daily life.
</p>

<h2>Graphic Design</h2>

<p>
The way I distinguish graphic design from drawing is whether the work requires
computer skills or not. Getting familiar with design softwares was one of the
most unexpected experience I got from college. Began with very little
knowledge of it, in my senior year I was able to accept freelance cases from 
the school, or conduct an editorial work of a thirty-page yearbook.<br />
<br />
Usually a graphic design work of mine came from a need in the first place. It
could be a promotional poster, a team t-shirt for student activity, or a cover
for information booklet. The pressure of product deadlines and the bloom of
internet resources were the sources from which I gained my skill of using design
softwares.<br />
<br />
Picture below shows two of my design works. The left-sided one was a poster for 
the annual concert we held in the EE department, and the right-sided one was a
t-shirt design made for an activity held by student association.<br />

<h2>Illustration</h2>

<p>
There is often a case where we need to put together an informative document,
whether it is a booklet, a webpage, or an assignment report, and feel like there
could use some pictures rather than plain text. Often times I make some
illustrations that are not a complete item by themselves, but need to be put
together with other mediums to fully function. Being flexible in the size and
the style is the most important thing to me when doing illustrations.<br />
<br />
Image below is part of a bigger collection of icons and thumbnails I created
for a game booklet. I also apply same skills when creating elements for games.<br />

<h2>Digital Assets</h2>

<p>
Being the rare case of a person who can do art in the group of engineers,
creating assets and have them manipulated by computer programs is one thing
I feel exceptionally comfortable in doing. I understand what color depth,
image resolution, and ambient light mean as technical terms, and I also
have the instinct of how each of them might affect the visual output. Because
I am aware of how assets as file data are handled and manipulated inside of a
computer, a lot of times I can figure out efficient pipeline when using software
to create digital assets.<br />

<p>
Picture to the right are screenshots from a game which two of my college
classmates and I made. I created all the visual elements required for the game
including the character portraits, backgounds, interface icons and designed
where all of them should be displayed on the screen of a cell phone. My
classmate who did the programming then put them all together with Qt Library.<br />
<br />
We published the game to Nokia's Ovi Store and got featured once on their front
page. This was only an experimental product since none of us had publication experience
before and just kind of wanted to see if it could actually sell. Turned out it does,
and this was also one very fun thing to do!
</p>

<h2>Location-based Pieces</h2>

<p>
In addition to working on paper or on computer screens, I have also done some work
in larger scale, ones that were designed to take up some physical space in real
world. Doing things like this requires more sense in the overall planning than the
attention to details, and it also has to be fast and firm since usually it is not
allowed to go back and refine. The impact these can bring to people also differ a
lot from paper or computer works.

<p>
Picture above was a photograph taken at the last piece I made before graduating from college. It
was made to be a stage banner for the graduation show helded by my class. Purposes
like this &#8211; to create items that can bring better experience to people who see it &#8211; is what drives me along the way of a self-taught art hobbist.
