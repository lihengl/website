<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
If someone ever believes in the difference between left-handed people and
right-handed people, or tries to analyze the existence of conflict between
analytical thinking and emotion-driven behavior, I should be one ideal
candidate to be observed.<br />
<br />
I was born with a left hand which seemed to know how to draw and write out
of the box. Having considered that as a talent, I decided to let it grow by
itself and went learning engineering instead. That is where my
brain got nurtured and shaped by math and physics and formulas, while some
part of my nerve system, specifically the part that connects directly to my
left hand, seemed to remain intact.<br />
<br />
Alright, that was about the best literature piece I can do and I should cease
trying here.<br />
<br />
I was born, raised, and educated at the island of Taiwan. My parents gave me
an eye-hand pair that can draw things I formulate in my brain, and I went to
pursuit myself a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at the country's
best university. These two things may sound loosely, or not at all coupled at
a glance, but there actually was a connection between them. The connection was
the TV our family had at home.<br />
<br />
The thirty-minute cartoon series which were played every Wednesday afternoon
used to be the most exciting thing that could happen when I was in
kindergarten. Many times I have tried to create cartoons myself, but my
character on the paper would simply refuse to move. When I got into elementary
school I was able to produce a moving sequence that was about five second long
with the page corners of our thickest textbook, but it was still nothing close
to the featured animations or the video game characters I saw on the TV.<br />
<br />
Realizing the largely missing part lay in the world of technology, I went
through the path of math and science and that finally brought me to where I am
at today, an university in United States known for its school of computer
science, taking classes related to computer graphics, programming
collaboratively with engineers from around the world.<br />
<br />
Up to this point I finally understood how the moving pictures that have
brought excitement and joy to me were made possible. Moreover, I have started
to feel my interests in drawing has begun to blend with my knowledge in
technology.<br />
<br />
I look forward applying all that I have learned to make good things appear to
the world.<br />
</p>

<h2>My Goal</h2>

<p>
To bring happiness to people, with the things that have also brought happiness to me.
