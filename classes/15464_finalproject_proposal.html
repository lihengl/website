<h2>Title</h2>

<p>
Three Dimensional Smoke Simulation
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>
This project to me is really an implementation practice. I am curious in how
people do physically based simulation, both in the tools on the surface and
the theory that lies underneath. After I have done the third project in this
course, a simple cloth simulation, I have granted a brief idea of how a
physically-based simulation graphics program usually looks like. From here
I would like to explore a little bit further into the topic, by picking another
subject to simulate - smoke.<br>
<br>
An ideal result of my smoke simulation would consists of the following features:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>first of all, it has to be able to be perceived as smoke</li>
<li>real-time</li>
<li>three-dimensional</li>
<li>provide some interaction to the viewer</li>
<li>finally, if possible, a non-photo-realistic look of the smoke</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also I am hoping that during the implementaion process, I would be able to
identify as many mutually exclusive parameters that determine the look of the
smoke.<br>
</p>

<p>
The reason I picked smoke as my subject was mainly because it is something
interesting to watch in the real world, and there is definitely some rules
of the nature that forms its behavior, which to me at this point have absolute
no idea. Smoke is also something that the artists have been having difficulties
trying to express by hand. As a person who is also highly interested in doing
art work, I am passionate to see if there could be a solution in the technical
world that might also be appreciated by art people.

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>
I would like to tryout a shader approach for the rendering process. It seems to
be the way to go if I want to achieve a real-time simulation. More reading in
this area is required.<br>
<br>
There will be no user input to this program since I will be hard-coded in all the
initial conditions. Viewers should be able to see an animated smoke coming out
from an emitter once the program launches. After this point, the program should
receive keyboard and/or mouse input allowing the viewer to manipulate view point
and move the emitter around. Should I find any parameter that changes the look of
the smoke, it should also be adjustable during run-time by keyboard inputs.

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>
Smoke simulation is actually a topic that some of my classmates have done in
their previous classes. I have received several reference papers that they used,
and is planning to read them before doing any actual coding. These papers are:<br>

<p>
I was advised to implement a two-dimensional smoke first. The advise will also
be followed.

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>
I am planning for a live demo of my smoke simulation program using my laptop
during the final presentation class. Things that I discovered throughout the
process, as well as questions and comments can then be shared.

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>
To be honest, I only have an estimated of one week to work on this project. I have
setup several milestones that should be hit in a strict time step. These are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the reference papers [1/7]</li>
<li>Program the framework for handling update/render/event cycles [1/7]</li>
<li>Implement a two-dimensional smoke [2/7]</li>
<li>Implement a three-dimensional smoke [3/7]</li>
</ol>

<p>
Step one and two are definite feasible ones, while step three and four are still
vague to me at this point regarding their difficulties. For a worse case scenario
I would have a working two-dimensional smoke simulator, so the main check point
would be when can I finish implementing the two-dimensional smoke.<br>
