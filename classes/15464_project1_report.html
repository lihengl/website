<!--Overview-->

<hr>

<b><font size=+1>Overview:</font></b>

<p>

In this assignment we were asked to edit motion data with two approaches: 
both writing a program and using Autodesk Maya software. The input we got
was two walking animations that can either be manipulated and viewed with
a starter code base or Maya.

</p>

<p>

My goal is to make the walking animation looks different, as if giving the
character more emotions since the original walk was a fairly plain one.
Although I achieved something with the Maya approach, the programming approach
was not as successful. Details for both approaches, as well as the observations
I got throughout the process is described below.

<!--Using Maya-->

<b><font size=+1>Using Maya:</font></b>

<p>

The software I used for this assignment is Autodesk Maya 2011, running on a 
Windows Vista Business 64-bit machine. 

</p>

<p><b>1. Result:</b></p>

<p>

Here is the result that I put onto the internet. I think the result talks more by itself compare
with words, so I decided to show the video first to whoever reading this.

</p>

<p><b>2. Methods:</b></p>

<p>

Below is a list of what I modifications I made to the original motion data in order 
to achieve each different walk styles.

<ul>

	<li><b>Robotic:</b><br>
	1. Rotate forarms to align with upperarms<br>
	2. Scale down oscillation angles of the forarms to almost zero<br>
	3. Scale up z(up) translation of the feet IKs<br>
	4. Rotate lowerback backwards a bit<br>
	5. Rotate neck backwards a bit<br><br>

	<li><b>Determined:</b><br>
	1. Rotate forwarms forward a bit<br>
	2. Translate feet IKs backward a bit<br>
	3. Rotate lowerback forward a bit (both 2. and 3. were to lean the character forward)<br>
	4. Rotate neck backward a bit to make the character still looking forward<br><br>

	<li><b>Relaxed:</b><br>
	1. Rotate lowerback backward<br>
	2. Scale up the oscillation angles of both arms<br><br>
	
	<li><b>Defeated:</b><br>
	1. Rotate lowerback forward for a fair amount of degree<br>
	2. Scale down z(up) translation of feet IKs<br><br>
	
	<li><b>Fearless:</b><br>
	1. Move x(forward) translation forward so that the feet goes a bit futher than the whole body<br>
	2. Rotate backarms backward a bit<br>
	3. Rotate lowerback backward a bit<br>
	4. Rotate upperback forward a bit<br>
	5. Scale down the oscillation angles of both arms<br><br>

	<li><b>Not-So-Manly:</b><br>
	1. Rotate arms to the shape as seen in the video (could not explain this better...)<br>
	2. Rotate legs toward the center of the body<br>
	3. Scale down z(up) translation of the feet IKs<br>
	4. Scale up the oscillation angles of lowerback<br>
	5. Scale up the oscillation angles of neck about x(forward) axis<br><br>

	<li><b>Sneaky:</b><br>
	1. Move z(up) translation of root downward with a fair amount of distance<br>
	2. Rotate lowerback forward with a fair amount of degree<br>
	3. Rotate neck backward until the character is looking forward again<br>
	4. Rotate forearms to align with backarms<br>
	5. Rotate backarms away from the center of the body<br>
	6. Scale up the oscillation angles of lowerback<br>
	7. Scale down the oscillation angles of backarms<br>
	8. Scale down z(up) translation of the feet IKs<br><br>

	<li><b>Joyful:</b><br>
	1. Scale up the oscillation distance of z(up) translation of root<br>
	2. Scale up z(up) translation distance of the feet IKs<br>
	3. Rotate lowerback backward a bit<br>
	4. Rotate neck backward for a fair amount of degree<br>
	5. Rotate forearms until they are in right angles with backarms<br>
	6. Scale up the oscillation angles of backarms with a fair amount of degree<br><br> 

</ul>

<p><b>3. Observations:</b></p>

<p>

After playing around with the Maya software which I almost had no prior experience with,
I figured out that for the purpose of editing, not starting a new animation from scratch,
using the Graph Editor in Maya is a good way to go. I have only used the Graph Editor for
this assignment. There are probably a lot more tools that Maya has to provide, but given
the time contraint, it is the tool of my choice. Several observations I found is listed
below:


<ul>

	<li><b>It is really easy to break the animation by modifying timing.</b><br>
	Every attributes of the bones in the skeleton, including translations, rotations, and scale
	are all values over time. As I was trying to see what moving around the graph will do,
	I discovered that whenever I tried to modify the timing, it is very easy to make the
	animation "look wrong". For example, one thing I was trying to do is to make the character
	walk more "powerful", and I was hoping to achieve it by having both the feet and the arms
	reach their local destination (or, local peak value on the graph) faster. The way I tried
	was to steepen the slope of the sin-like graph of the rotation attibutes while maintain
	their period. However, the result by simply doing is looked weird, and I belive it has to
	do with that not only the arm and the feet, but also the torso the root, or basically the
	whole body needs to adjust to that speed change in order for the motion to look natural or
	believable. If time permit I might be able to conquer this, but there was no easy way to
	do it effectively during my experiment.<br><br>	

	<li><b>The spine bones matter a lot</b><br>
	The very first effective change that I made was the overall angle of the lowerback bone.
	The angle of lowerback bone determines the leaning angle of the body, and this determines
	a large part of the style of our character. Generally leaning forward makes the character
	looks more focused, while leaning backward makes the character looks more relaxed or absent-
	minded. However, if leaning forward to a large amount of degree, it will turn into quite a
	nother result as the "defeated" one shown in the video.<br><br>

	<li><b>Oscillation angles also matters a lot</b><br>
	Walking is a cycling motion. Except for the x(forward)-translation in this assignment, which
	moves the character forward, everything is osillating in some waveform if viewed from the
	Graph Editor. For almost every motions the amplitude of the waveform is something I would
	definitely play around with. Not only they changes the style/feel of the motions a lot, but
	also I found them relatively safe to play around with. That means, as long as you do not
	modify them too far, the resulting animtation would remain in a decent quality state.<br><br>
		

</ul>

<!--Using the Code Base-->

<hr>

<b><font size=+1>Using the Code Base</font></b>

<p>

I have to say here at the beginning of the section that I failed to achieve what I was trying to do
with the programming approach for this assignment. Either it was because I spent to much time playing
with Maya, or it took me too long to realize how to do motion editing with programs. After figured out
how to setup the starter code on my working machine and read (some part) of the provided code, I
decided to write my own parser to edit the motion data. Within the timing contraint I have only reached
the point where I got the data loaded into memory, but could not made the next step forward of applying
different editing functions to it.

</p>

<p>

Source code of my unfinished program can be downloaded 
<a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lihengl/15464/lihengl_amc_editor.zip">here</a>
, although it may not mean anything at this
point since it is really not something that works. I am planning to keep working on it since the next
assignment will be based on the same framework and data format, and hopefully by that time I would have
a functional motion editor for the motion capture data at my disposal.

</p>

<p><b>1. Result:</b></p>

<p>

Here is the result of my program-edited motion data. Really, there is not much to say about it since the
difference from the original data can barely be seen.

</p>

<br>

<br>

<p><b>2. The Original Idea:</b></p>

<p>

If I were to finish the editing program in time, the next step was going to be applying various
functions to the motions. Things that I would like to try was:

<ul>

	<li>Scaling<br>
	<li>Offset<br>
	<li>Non-linear Attenuation<br>

</ul>

<p>

But unfortunately I was unable to achieve it. Would strive for a better job for next assignment.

</p>
<br>


<!--Comparison Between the Two Approaches-->

<hr>

<b><font size=+1>Comparison Between the Two Approaches</font></b>

<p>

For experience I have more on the programming side than to the 3D software side. However in this assignment I had quite amount
of fun playing Maya, but not as much trying to get my code to work. Maya is such a big software that seems to have billions of
features in it. What I was trying to achieve with code was probably something similar to the Graph Editor in Maya, except for the
fancy interface.

</p>

<p>

This being said, I believe there is a lot more we can do with motion editing using computer programs. After all, there is actually
very little Maya can do if trying to build some real-time applications. Reading the file format of motion capture data gave me
an understanding of how human skeleton is can be modeled, and also how animation is really the change of values over time.
