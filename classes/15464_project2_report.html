<!--Overview-->

<b><font size=+1>Overview:</font></b>

<p>

In this assignment we were asked to implement two common methods for achieving
the inverse kinematics mechanism: Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) and Jacobian.
An OpenGL C++ code base which shows an animated humanoid skeleton in a window
was provided, as well as several handouts describing the two methods. 

</p>

<p>

My goal for this assignment is to implement the two methods, identify some
possibe differnces between their behaviors, and provide some interactivity
related to the IK chain. For the outcome, I have implemented the CCD mothod, 
but sadly not the Jacobian. Interactivity is provided to the point where 
users can switch between four predefined IK chains and change the position
of their end effector targets using solely keyboard inputs. The original
interaction behavior of the applcation remains unchanged.

<b><font size=+1>Demo Video:</font></b>

<p>

Here is the video demonstration of the IK system, implemented on top of the given
motion browser application:

</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20969772?portrait=0" width="440" height="341" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>

The video shows possible interaction using keyboard and mouse, as well as the
IK mechanism of CCD method. Jacobian method is not demonstrated in this video
since it is not implemented at this point.

<!--Implementation-->

<b><font size=+1>Implementation:</font></b>

<p>

The program is an extension of the given motion browser code base, which loads in 
a predefined skeleton and several motion data that comes with it. It was mostly
implemented on my personal machine under Mac OS X, but it is tested to compile and
run on CMU GHC cluster machines.

</p>

<p><b>1. Compile (under linux)</b></p>

<p>

To compile the program, under the working directory (which is "assign2/ik_viewer/" 
for this assignmnet) just run the jam file. Once succefully compiled, an executable
called "browser"  will then be created under the "dist" directory.

</p>

<p><b>2. Run:</b></p>

<p>

Simply execute the "browser" file within the "dist" directory. A window with
a static skeleton will show up on the screen. You should see four lines connecting
the bones of both arms and legs, and four wireframed cubes and the end of those. 
The lines represent the connection of an IK chain, and the center of the cubes 
indicate where the targets of the chains are.<br>
Additional keyboard functions are listed below:

</p>

<ul>

	<li><b>Left/Right Key:</b><br>
        Cycle through the four predefined IK chains. Currently selected chain is highlighted yellow.<br><br>

	<li><b>I Key:</b><br>
	Toggle between CCD and Jacobian modes.<br><br>

	<li><b>Q/W Key:</b><br>
	Decrease/Increase the x-coordinate value of the target of currently selected IK chain.<br><br>
	
	<li><b>A/S Key:</b><br>
	Decrease/Increase the y-coordinate value of the target of currently selected IK chain.<br><br>
	
	<li><b>Z/X Key:</b><br>
	Decrease/Increase the z-coordinate value of the target of currently selected IK chain.<br><br>
	
</ul>

<p>

The above input methods, while provied interaction I intended to make the application have, and
also do the job of visualizing IK chains, are not the original idea I had. What I was trying to
achieve in the first place was to allow the user to drag the faces of the cubes, which represents
target for that IK chain, and move them along their corresponding xyz axis, much like the manipulators
in Maya. However, I did not have time to look into how to do the OpenGL object picking, and had
to just use easier but quite unintuitive keyboard approach as it is right now.

</p>

<p><b>3. Source Code:</b></p>

<p>

For this implementation, while trying to alter the starter code as little as possible, still 
involves some modification to the provided source code. Additional source files were also
created, and they all reside in a newly created directory named "Ik". Comments were placed
at each point where I put new lines of code and whenever I did some specific assumptions.<br>
Below is a list of things I have done related to the code:

<ul>

	<li><b>Ik/IkChain.cpp & Ik/IkChain.hpp</b><br>
        I created the "IkChain" object to visualize and store information needed to form an IK
        chain. It takes two NAMES of bones and forms an IK chain, making the bone with the first
        name the root of the chain and the bone with the second name the end. I made certain
        contrains here deciding what makes a valid IK chain, namely: 1) Chains can only be formed
        in the direction from the root of the skeleton to the end bones. and 2. The number of bones
        in a single chain is capped by 4. The first contraint is to avoid chains that do not make
        sense. The second contrain is mainly for limiting the complexity of finding the solution 
        for the chain.<br><br> 

	<li><b>Ik/IkSolver.cpp & Ik/IkSolver.hpp</b><br>
        This is where the actual implementation for CCD and Jacobian methods go. One of the two
        solver function is called every update cycle, taking one of the valid IK chain as argument. 
        NOTE: when looking into the Jacobian part in IkSOlver.cpp, you would see a TODO there. This
        means that the Jacobian method is not implemented yet.<br><br>

        <li><b>Library/Library.cpp & Library/Library.hpp</b><br>
        As suggested by Matt, I added the set_angles() method into class Motion.<br><br>

        <li><b>Browser/BrowserMode.cpp & Browser/BrowserMode.hpp</b><br>
        Added new key input event handlers for the above mentioned input methods. Added the IK
        chain objects, setup some constants and fix the motion at a specific frame so that the 
        whole skeleton will not be looping animation and then can be used to better demonstrate 
        the IK mechanism.<br><br>

</ul>

<p>

The implementation is not done. There are still a lot more that can/should be done. However I did spend
some time making the structure of the code as extendable as possible so that once I get back it can be
easily picked up.

<!--Observations-->

<b><font size=+1>Observations</font></b>

<p>

Except for the difference in how complicated it is to implement the two methods (CCD is much more straight-forward 
than the case for Jacobian), and the sad face that there is still mistakes in the implementation of CCD (it seems
to be working properly for legs, but not on the arms, while I really call the same solver function on them), I did
notice an interesting behavior of CCD: at the point of changing the increment direction of the target (e.g., after
moving the target up for several steps, move it down), the movement of the bone will continue in its original direction
for some more steps before reversing.<br>
I am not sure, however, if this is actually the characteristics of CCD or just another mistake I made in the implementation...

<!--Future Work-->


<b><font size=+1>Future Work</font></b>

<p>

Although somewhat complicated, this is a fun assignment. It suggested a nice motivation to figure out what is takes
to form a 3D humanoid skeleton that can be manipulatd and animated.<br>
A lot of things can and should be done still, including a working Jacobian, a better control interface, and probably
a more generic IK system that can be applied to other types or other formats of skeletons. It might also be interesting
if specifying each joint an extra value representing their priority level when performing some motion. Doing this
might give us a more natural-looking motion of the IK.<br>
