<!--Overview-->

<hr>

<b><font size=+1>Overview:</font></b>

<p>

In this assignment we were asked to implement a cloth simulation with simple
spring-force model and Forward Euler Integration method. A starter code base
with lighting, camera and a chessboard floor with shadow and reflection rendering
is provided in C++ and OpenGL.

</p>

<p>

My goal of this assignment is to explore the basic cloth simulation method,
the characteristics of the spring-force model and the Forward Eular Integration,
as well as setup the color and lighting of the scene to get an appealing
visual output.

<b><font size=+1>Result:</font></b>

<p>

Below is a real-time screen recording of my implementation of the cloth simulation
program. The slowness of the movement is due to the limitation of Forward Euler
Integration. If a faster movement were specified, the simulation will become unstable
and the cloth will break apart in a matter of few seconds. The rendering is done
with default OpenGL setup.

( I uploaded the video in a rush and forgot to remove the sound part of it, so it
has an annoying backround sound picked up by my computer as I was recording the
video. You can turn off the sound volume with the toolbar on the video. Sorry. )

<p>

During the middle part of the video I turned on the rendering for spring forces as lines.
It shows the structure of the spring-force model with stretch, damp, and shear springs.

<!--Implementation Notes-->

<b><font size=+1>Implementation Notes:</font></b>

<p>

The program was mainly developed on my laptop under Mac OSX 10.6 with Xcode IDE and GCC 4.2
as its compiler. It was also tested to compile and run on the CMU GHC cluster machines.
 
</p>

<p>

There is not much to talk about in the implementation of this assignment. I removed all the unrelated code
in the starter, and coded the spring force obejct, gravity force object, particle object and
the cloth object which is a composition of the previous three object types. <br>
<br>
There are several parameters that I left tunable, these are:
<br>
1. Resolution of the cloth  ( it is 20 by 20 in the video shown above ) <br>
2. Mass of the cloth ( it is set so that every particle has a mass of 1.0 in the video shown above ) <br>
3. Constant Ks of the springs ( it is set to 650 ) <br>
4. Constant Kd of the springs ( it is set to 150 ) <br>
<br>
I have set the gravity constant G to 9.80 and had intentionally made it unchanged.<br>
<br>
At the start of the simulation, the cloth is put horizontal in the air. I explicitly pinned two particles
at the corner to have fixed position, so as to make the cloth swing downward to observe its behavior.<br>
<br>
The rendering is done with OpenGL fixed-funtionality pipeline primitive commands ( e.g. glBegin()/glEnd() ).
In order to get a better visual output, I played around a little with the color of the cloth and the lightings.
In addition to the one only light enabled by the starter code base, I put a secondary directional light on
the floor, shooting upward hoping to simulate a reflected illumination. As a result, the cloth will not
turn completely darken when facing downward during its swing.

<!--Using Maya nCloth System-->

<b><font size=+1>Using Maya nCloth System</font></b>

<p>

Autodesk Maya has a cloth simulation system called nCloth. Below is a demo video I made with
the system, using a plane of resolution 32 by 32 with simple texture. Every other attributes
were default by Maya 2011.

<!--Observations-->

<b><font size=+1>Observations</font></b>

<p>

The biggest surprise while implementing this simulation program was the moment Forward Euler gave an unstable
result. The piece of cloth will just literally break apart in a matter of few seconds after the simulation
started.<br>
<br>
Haveing checked that the implementation itself was correct, I went into tuning the parameters trying to get
a nice-looking and stable result. The constraints were discovered that we cannot make the mass of the cloth too
small or it will fall apart, and we cannot make the spring constants too large or it will also fall apart.<br>
<br>
The reason for making the mass small and the spring constants large is that, while using 9.80 as the absolute
gravity constant, the cloth will appear to be very "heavy" to an extent that it no will no longer look like a
piece of cloth, but something more like a liquidfied material or something. The straight forward approach to
solve this is to make the cloth lighter or the springs "stronger", which means a smaller value for the mass of
the cloth and bigger values for both the spring constants. Having found that tuning these parameters in these
direction will cause a fall apart eventually, I set them to the point where the simulation remains stable, and
the visual was believable.<br>
<br>
Another thing I realized during the implementation was that for the Forward Eular integration step, instead of
passing the actual time difference between current and last update, it has to be a fixed and reasonably small
value. This means if the simulator program is not running at constant speed, the simulated result will not
be precise.<br>
<br>
Compared with Maya nCloth, not only can Maya do this in apparently real-time, but also it captures a phenomenom
when the cloth swings to the straight position, there is a "bouncing wave" generated from the tail and travels
upwards. This seems to be something the spring-force model cannot capture, thus made me curious what alternative
model for cloth does Maya use.<br>

<!--Future Work-->

<b><font size=+1>Future Work</font></b>

<p>

There are several things that I would like to explore:<br>
<br>
1. Second/Fouth order Runge-Kutta method: this will enable a faster, closer to real-time simulation.<br>
2. Collision: start with simple geometry such as sphere or cube, then to self-collision.<br>
3. Other forces such as wind.<br>
<br>
Above are ranked with their degree of improvement to the program.
