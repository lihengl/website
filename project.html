<p class="showcase">Raytracer Program Output with Zero/Five Bounce Reflection | C++ with SDL and libpng, April 2011</p>
</div>

<h2>Welcome to the Tech World</h2>

<p>I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University. It
was the school which gave me a solid training in math, physics, knowledge of computer, and most
importantly, problem solving skills every engineer should have. After I came to Carnegie Mellon,
I had the opportunity to participate in various kinds of projects, mainly as the role of programmer.
Programming collaboratively with other engineers was one of the most valuable lessons I learned
during my graduate study.<br />
<br />
In addition to teamwork practice, I also took several classes from Carnegie Mellon's School of
Computer Science. The area where I have the most interest in is computer graphics. The image above
is an output of one of my assignment project. It is an image rendered by a raytracer written
in C++ with SDL and libpng libraries.<br />

<br />
This is a semester-long project at Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center,
pitched by six graduate students. Our goal was to allow people who enjoy playing different types
of games can play one same game together, having everyone interact with each other with their
own game type of choice.<br />
<br />
We picked first-person shooting, racing, and 2D puzzle game as our target genres becuase we believed
this particular set covers a wide enough range of gamer types and was sufficient to prove our point &#8211;
that a game like this can actually be done and be fun.<br />
<br />
The rule of the game was setup to be team-versus-team, point-based competitive. Whichever team earns
the certain amount of points more than the other team wins the round. Reason for team-versus-team was
because we believed it has more dynamics than team-versus-ai, which is good for an experiment.
The reason for making it point-based competitive is because point system is the one thing that appears
in all game types.<br />

<p>
One biggest challenge of making this game lay in the balancing between different genres. Our
goal was to make players able to play with whoever people they want to play with ( as
long as they like one of the three genres we provided ) so we had to give all players a 
freedom to choose whatever genre they want to play. In other words, we needed to make sure a team
with three racers was equally powerful than a team composited of all three different genres, as well as a team
with pure puzzle players or pure shooters.<br />
<br />
Another issue we ran into was information passing. Players of different game genres play games
differently, and they care about different issues or expect different things to happen in their
game world. Making sure every players get the same experience they expect to have when they play their genre of
choice, while giving them an additional sense of interaction with other types of players happened to be
a really difficult task. We managed to deal with this part largely by improving on-screen interface
notifications and environmental hints iteratively, along with user testing.<br />
<br />
We built the game with Unity3D game engine. I was one of the three programmers in the team, and was mostly
in charge of the 2D aspect of the game. In particular, I implemented our puzzle game representitive,
a spin-off version of Bejeweled.<br />

<h2>Graphics Programming</h2>

<p>I found it very enjoyable programming graphics applications when I took the Computer Graphics
class provided by Carnegie Mellon. During the class we implemented various topics such as mesh
subdivion, shader programming and raytracer. All of the projects were done in C++, with OpenGL
as graphics API and SDL as windowing/interaction library.<br />
<br />
Because OpenGL and SDL are both cross-platform libraries, and also because the school required
us to submit our programs to Linux machine, while my desktop computer runs Windows and I own an
macbook, I had the chance to practice porting the same graphics program onto three different 
operating systems.<br />
<br />
Images to the right are screenshots of a same program, running on three different platforms.
It was taken from an assignment which we practiced implementing an algorithm to subdivide triangle
mesh - namely, the Loop Subdivision Algorithm. Having an effecient data structure for the mesh
to be subdivide was an crucial part of this assignment, and my implementation of using the
winged-edge structure performed comparably fast during execution.<br />
<br />
In addition to Computer Graphics, I also took the Technical Animation class at Carnegie Mellon.
The class talked about various topics related to computer animation, ranging from motion capture
to physically based simulation. For class projects we implemented an inverse kinematic control for
a given humanoid skeleton, as well as a cloth simulation with spring-damping model. Everything
were also done in C++ and OpenGL.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in the front page of this website, one of the things I would really want to be
able to achieve is that one day, I can design my own character, put him into a computer program I
wrote, and have him animated as if it were alive and will entertain whoever sees it. Having
taken the fundamental classes at Carnegie Mellon was really just a start, but also a rather solid
start that I appreciate.<br />

<h2>Remote Game Controller Using Oracle's SunSPOT</h2>

<p>
One of the semesters at Carnegie Mellon I had the chance to be introduced to an interesting device called the
"SunSPOT", which was originally developed by Sun Microsystem. The name SunSPOT stands for "Sun Small Programmable
Object Technology", and it allows software programmers to program the piece of hardware with Java language, almost
the same way we program Java applications on computers.<br />
<br />
</p>

<div class="rightcase">

The player's lefthand was controlling pedal/break,<br />
and righthand tilting left/right for steering.
</p>
</div>

<p>
One aspect of SunSPOT that I found particularlly interesting is that it can easily be held in hand, and transmit
its current acceleration values in space to a remote computer in real-time. With this, and the ability of Java itself to
trigger keyboard/mouse events programmatically, I put together an interface that allows people to use SunSPOT as
a remote controller and play existing computer games that might be more fun playing with hand motions, rather than
traditional keyboard and mouse.<br />
<br />
This interface system was completely built in Java, so it can run on multiple computer platforms with very little
modification to the source code, as long as the computer has Java environment properly setup. This project not
only gave me the experience to play a little bit with human-computer interaction methods, but also helped me understand some
of the strengh that Java language provides to the programmers.
